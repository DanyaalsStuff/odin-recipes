        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            A classic comfort food, the grilled cheese sandwich 
            is a simple yet satisfying combination. Two slices 
            of bread, typically white or sourdough, are buttered 
            or coated in mayonnaise and toasted until golden brown. 
            Melty cheese, often cheddar, Swiss, or Gruy√®re, is 
            sandwiched between the bread, creating a warm, gooey center. 
            This quick and easy dish can be enjoyed on its own 
            or dipped in tomato soup for a nostalgic and delicious 
            meal. Random text generated with Gemini-AI.</p>
