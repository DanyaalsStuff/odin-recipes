            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Pancakes, a beloved breakfast staple,
                are fluffy, round cakes made from a batter
                of flour, eggs, milk, and a leavening agent
                like baking powder. Cooked on a hot griddle or
                pan, they develop a golden brown exterior and a
                light, airy interior filled with tiny bubbles.
                Depending on preference, they can be thin and
                delicate or thick and decadent. Typically
                enjoyed for breakfast, pancakes are often
                drizzled with maple syrup and dotted with
                butter, but can also be dressed up with fresh
                fruit, whipped cream, or even savory ingredients
                like cheese and herbs.</p>
